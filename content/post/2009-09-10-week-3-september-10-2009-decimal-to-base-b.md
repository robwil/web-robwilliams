title: Week 3 – September 10, 2009 – Decimal to Base B

**Purpose:**

This week I was extraordinarily busy with random things, and so I didn’t have too much time to set aside for things. That said, I made a very simple little program in Flex that converts a given decimal (base 10) number to a given base. It also allows you to define a custom base (since after Base 36 who knows what you want). The code for it is less than 20 lines. Not much went into this, but I didn’t want to go a whole two weeks without practicing some Flex.

**Flex Results:**

You can download the source code [here](/weekly/Week3_Flex_DecimalToBase.zip "Week 3 Flex Source Code").

You can view/run the program [here](/flash/week3_decimal/main.html "Week 3 Flex Program").

**Conclusion:**

Now that school has started, I likely won’t have a lot of time for these projects. I’m going to try to make an effort to do at least tiny little projects each week to keep myself somewhat familiar with each language. I’m hoping this doesn’t become too much of a trend because I’d like to put more than 30 minutes into these projects, to hopefully make something more useful.
