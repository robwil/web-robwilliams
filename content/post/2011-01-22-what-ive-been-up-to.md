title: What I&#8217;ve Been Up To

I haven&#8217;t been posting much on this site lately because of the unfortunate fact that I haven&#8217;t been doing many programming projects. School last semester was unnecessarily busy because I overloaded on extracurricular commitments, and in between homework and tutoring and everything else, I had very little time to sit down and write code. Couple that with the &#8220;coder&#8217;s block&#8221; I&#8217;ve been experiencing lately, where I have very few ideas for programs I want to create, and you have for a long drought of programming creativity. Luckily, over winter break I was able to rekindle some of the old programming excitement, and I started teaching myself <a title="Scala Programming Language" href="http://www.scala-lang.org" target="_blank">Scala</a>.

I blew through <a title="Programming Scala: Tackling Multicore Complexity on the Java Virtual Machine" href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Scala-Multi-Core-Complexity-Programmers/dp/193435631X/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1295733947&sr=8-3" target="_blank">a great book on the language</a>. I must say that overall I am impressed. Syntactically and conceptually, the language feels fresh and cool and practically-speaking rapid to develop. Because such a focus inside the language is on the concurrent design pattern of <a title="Wikipedia: Actor Model" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model" target="_blank">actors</a>, I wanted to try to improve one of my favorite projects of the past with some concurrency. I dusted off my old <a title="Episode Renamer" href="http://robwilliams.me/2009/09/week-4-september-14-2009-episode-renamer/" target="_blank">Episode Renamer</a> and decided to port it to Scala to see just how much performance gain I could get  from the concurrency. You can check out the results in that post.

Other than Scala, I&#8217;ve penciled in a two-hour block of each week devoted to either programming or coming up with ideas for projects. Whether or not I am able to keep this appointment with myself once my schedule starts to fill is another matter, but I am hoping the forced brainstorming will at least lead to an interesting project or two that I can work on and write about here.
