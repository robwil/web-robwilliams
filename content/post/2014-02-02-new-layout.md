I created a new WordPress theme for this blog today. It&#8217;s super simplistic, but since I&#8217;m not a designer that&#8217;s usually the best bet for me. It&#8217;s basically just Bootstrap 2 with two fluid columns that look decent enough down to mobile size, then I added a font and some colors for nice measure. I haven&#8217;t done a ton of testing, like if any of my old posts still look okay, but overall I&#8217;m happy with it.

The full source code for the theme is available on my Github profile <a title="Github: RobW2014" href="https://github.com/robwil/robw2014" target="_blank">here</a>.
