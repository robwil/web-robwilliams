I created a new WordPress theme for this blog today. It’s super simplistic, but since I’m not a designer that’s usually the best bet for me. It’s basically just Bootstrap 2 with two fluid columns that look decent enough down to mobile size, then I added a font and some colors for nice measure. I haven’t done a ton of testing, like if any of my old posts still look okay, but overall I’m happy with it.

The full source code for the theme is available on my Github profile [here](https://github.com/robwil/robw2014).
