As a programmer, I learn way too many programming languages. I suppose one can never know _too many_ languages, as they all have their pros and cons. The problem arises when I start to forget a language a month after I learn it. This happened to me way too many times over the past year to be a coincidence. Last winter I learned Flash and made [a game](/2009/01/risk-in-flash/ "Risk in Flash") to test my abilities. I really knew it well, but then I didn&#8217;t touch it in forever. In the Spring I learned Ruby on Rails in anticipation of my internship, and I also knew it pretty well, until I neglected it until the summer.

The thing I have learned is that you _will_ forget a language unless you use it! I use C/C++ all the time, and used Java extensively throughout my first year at Stevens, so I doubt I will forget either any time soon. This summer, I&#8217;ve begun using Javascript and Rails quite often, so I&#8217;ve regained my footing in Ruby on Rails and gotten decent at the voodoo that is Javascript. The point is, I recognize that I desperately need to practice coding in many languages in order to remember them.

I have decided to do weekly programming exercises. My class schedule for the Fall is rather sparse compared to the 21 credits I took last semester, so I expect to have at least enough free time to fit in one small personal programming project per week. What I am going to do is, every week starting on August 24, come up with a programming project. It could be a simple program to solve a problem I&#8217;ve been having, or it could be a traditional exercise, like something out of a programming challenges book (I have a bunch of those!). Either way, the idea is to create a unique (read: I&#8217;ve never programmed a similar thing before) program every week to keep my general programming skills sharp. Also, I plan on implementing the project in three different programming environments, to force myself to learn various parts of all these languages. The languages I have chose to start off with are all fairly modern programming environments:

  1. Ruby &#8211; with Rails if the program is suited to a web application
  2. Adobe Flex 3 &#8211; using Flash instead where there would be a benefit
  3. UIKit aka iPhone &#8211; possibly using Cocoa if the program won&#8217;t work as a mobile app

I am already thinking about the various projects I&#8217;m going to do in the coming weeks, and I think it will be a fun exercise (at least for me). I&#8217;m hoping at least a few of the programs I create are of use to others, but this is primarily meant to help me gain some programming experience and keep my knowledge of these three particular languages at a good point. With any luck, I&#8217;ll use them all so much that I remember them for a long time. 

The restriction I&#8217;m going to put on myself is that I&#8217;m only allowed to use one third party plug-in per language per project. This is to force myself to learn the built in features of the language and not just rely on plug-ins for absolutely everything. 

I expect to change which languages I&#8217;m working with at some point in the school year, but for right now I think these three will keep me plenty busy. I am going to be getting tons of C and Assembly practice in my general course work, and my Web Programming class should help me review PHP and Javascript. With all of those taken care of, I think I will be in good shape as far as knowing a lot of good languages for many different tasks.
